# SAVE THE OAK RIDGES MORAINE

The Save The Oak Ridges Moraine (**STORM**) Coalition has focused on protecting the ecological integrity of the Oak Ridges Moraine since 1989.

To accompany our website ([stormcoalition.com](https://www.stormcoalition.com/)). This repository holds STORM's *"[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)"* where ideas, knowledge, references, mapping and technology are shared openly.



# MAPS

STORM has invested much time in creating interactive online mapping tools to help inform and educate the public on the many functions the Oak Ridges Moraine has to offer and the legislative protections in place that are meant to protect this land. These maps also serve as a means to coordinate insights and knowledge brought to STORM through the engagement of our members and concerned citizens abroad. These maps are organic in that they are intended to update continuously--thus enabling a platform for communication and spreading awareness focussed on the moraine.

We encourage any and all feedback, whether it's training on how to use the tools and/or features one wished to have added. STORM's mission here is to re-invigorate community engagement toward the protection of the Oak Ridges Moraine.
