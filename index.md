# OAK RIDGES MORAINE

The Oak Ridges Moraine is one of Ontario's largest moraines, it extends 160 kilometres from the Niagara Escarpment in the west to the Trent River system in the east, and is on average 13 kilometres wide. 


# HISTORY

The idea for a coalition on the Oak Ridges Moraine flowed out of a meeting in October 1989 of community-based groups and individuals concerned about development pressures in different areas of the Oak Ridges Moraine.


# PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS AND RESOURCE MATERIAL

Information on our moraine partners and extensive resource library including government documents and various studies completed by STORM and others.
